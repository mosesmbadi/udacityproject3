### NOTES FOR THE REVIEWER
1. I couldn't get the build error for screenshot5 (Ensure backend infrastructure) Your guide was a little unclear so I watched a tutorial on that specific topic and created it.
2. I had issues with url of kvdb, so I commented them out while I try to get a response from my colleague regarding the errors.\
